#Dogecoin Price Prediction Project
**Overview:**
This project aims to develop predictive models for forecasting Dogecoin prices in the cryptocurrency market. The goal is to assist investors in making informed decisions by providing accurate price predictions and actionable insights based on historical data and advanced machine learning techniques.

**Project Structure:**
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** 
   - Gather historical Dogecoin price data from reliable sources such as cryptocurrency exchanges or financial APIs.
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explore the dataset to gain insights into Dogecoin price trends, volatility, and any underlying patterns.
   - Visualize key metrics and relationships to better understand the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Train multiple predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), and Facebook Prophet.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize the models for improved performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the most accurate and reliable predictor of Dogecoin prices.

5. **Prediction and Analysis:**
   - Generate future price forecasts using the selected model(s) and analyze the predicted trends and patterns.
   - Provide insights and recommendations to investors based on the model outputs, including optimal entry and exit points, risk assessment, and trading strategies.

6. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model development, evaluation results, and analysis findings.
   - Create visualizations, charts, and reports to present the project outcomes effectively.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, statsmodels, fbprophet

**Usage:**
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts sequentially to execute different stages of the project.
